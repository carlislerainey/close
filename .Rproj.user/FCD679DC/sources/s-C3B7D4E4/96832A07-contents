## Data

Data come from the [MIT Election Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/data). You can find the raw data on [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX).

The script `R/clean-data.R` wrangles the raw data into `data/votes-margin.rds` and ``data/votes-margin.rds`, which are just different file types for the clean data.

## Plot

Here's the plot made by `R/make-plot.R`.

## Table 

The table below shows the 10 closest contests.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
read_rds("data/votes-margin.rds") %>%
  top_n(-10, votes_margin) %>%
  arrange(votes_margin) %>%
  select(State = state,
         Year = year, 
         `Margin of Victory in Votes` = votes_margin) %>%
  kable(format = "markdown")
```
